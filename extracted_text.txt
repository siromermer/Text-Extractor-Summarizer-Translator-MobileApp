THE SIEGE OF GONDOR SII

In rode the Lord of the Nazgil. A great black shape against the fires
beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord
of the Nazgil, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and
all fled before his face.

All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate,
sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses
of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in
Rath Dinen.

‘You cannot enter here,” said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ‘Go
back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your Master. Go!’

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown;
and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and
the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a
deadly laughter.

‘Old fool!’ he said. ‘Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death
when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!’ And with that he lifted high
his sword and flames ran down the blade.
Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some
courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking
nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky
far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.

And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns,
horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin’s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns
of the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.
